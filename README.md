IDEA SUBMISSION 
Theme Selected:-  To manage/control/limit the disaster as much as possible.

1) The Problem :- It is generally seen that during a natural disaster, army camps/ relief camps are set up by the govt. to help the people and their welfare. But many a times, a person/group of people are stuck somewhere and neither they nor the army can't reach out to them. Also, it can be used if someone requires more help than already present at the site. 

2) Our Idea :- The Solution is to design a dynamic app which has a lot of editable options on the local map where the people are situated. The app will work under the following basic design :-

a) First of all, there will be two modes, SOS and Normal Mode. Whenever there is a natural tragedy(flood,earthquake,etc)/ artificial disaster( like terrorist attacks,mob violence,gang war,etc) , the app will get switched to SOS mode in real time itself. 

b) Suppose, some army/relief camp has been set up near some landmark during any natural calamity say flood,the app will provide an option to add a new landmark of "NEW RELIEF CAMP" at the existing place.AS a new landmark is set up, a notification pops up in every user in a radius of 100km. This will help the people to whom the army couldn't reach directly. If there's some person who is able to walk/ communicate after the disaster , he can directly view that landmark and reach out to army camps and ask for more help to rescue other people who were stuck with him initially.

c) Suppose it is not possible for a group of people to walk to near relief camps, the app will provide an option to make that place as a "NEED HELP URGENTLY". Again a notification pops up in the app of people in a radius of 100km. The NEED HELP URGENTLY option also has a sub-options of 1)number of people stuck with them at that place 2)people alive among them 3) people dead 4) people in critical situation 5) How many minimum relief people required for help.

d) Third Situation , if a large group of people are in a critical situation and the help present is not sufficient. The app provides a third option of "NEED MORE HELP" . This as soon as it is set up again notifies other users in a radius of 100km for more help. This option again has sub-options of 1) How many more helpers required 2) How much help is already present 3) How many people are stuck in all with alive,critical and dead numbers alloted.

e) Fourth Situation ,after reaching out to the relief camp, if some group again faces some problem like that of food,water or some member faces any medical issue suddenly and number of people of relief camps are not sufficient, they can push the "HELP INSIDE HELP" option. This option notifies the near-by functional hospital authorities who will reach with their emergency ambulances and staffs to help the needy.

f) Other Options under the app:-  
    `
     f.1) Post Calamity Funds:- The app will contain Payment Options just like in many other modern apps which can help in the welfare of people or can be used in National Relief fund after any calamity,
    
     f.2) Pre Calamity Funds:- The app will also set up digital payment methods to add up funds from people in their local area funds. This can be added whenever people of the area feel that a natural calamity may strike(upon predictions). This fund can be used later for them only.
     
     f.3) Prevention option:-  The app will take real time datas from weather-forecast agencies, security agencies etc. in case of the prediction of a natural calamity and will allow the users to create a "Prevent-Calamity" option under the SOS Mode. This will send messages to all local army base/air-force stations/naval base. They can directly go to the rescue zone before its too late. This will help to limit the effects of disaster.
